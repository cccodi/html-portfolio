<h2>Recently watched movies so far this 2025

    <hr />

<h3>The Final Destination: The Bloodline</h3>
<p>It was bloody as hell and very gruesome scenes everywhere. And it's all because of a coin and a stupid child lol. I don't recommend watching it while other people were sleeping beside you because you might wake them with your screams. Tbh, I prefer the first final destination movie.</p>

<h3>Insidious</h3>
<p>Too scary. I don't want to watch it ever again. And I won't be able to watch it alone ever.</p>

<h3>Bubble</h3>
<p>It was a cute fantasy anime movie. The animations was amazing and the sports the characters play was dangerously cool. It has good plot and justa lighthearted movie you can watch.</p>

<h3>Kpop Demon Hunters</h3>
<p>It's trending recently and Jona recommended it so I watched it. Animations are cool and it's easy to watch. It was just okay tho.</p>
